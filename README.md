# Unity-A-Star
A clean, light implementation of the infamous A* algorithm in Unity.

Most implementations I've found are either pretty large codebases, awefully written or even worse: both!
So, here's a lightweight, simple implementation of the classic A* algorithm in Unity.

I've left the most important fields public so you can see the constructed paths directly in the editor.

Just throw the AStarMaster component on a GameObject & you're good to go!
